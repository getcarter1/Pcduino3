FEX directory also contains pcduino3.fex generated from pcduino3.bin using sunxi-tools bin2fex utility.
fex file can be modified and .bin can be generated by using sunxi-tools fex2bin utility.

Replace Armbian's stock pcduino3.bin in /boot/bin with the newly created version

Issue command "sudo modprobe ft5x_ts". There should be no output.
"lsmod" command should show ft5x_ts loaded.
Output of cat /proc/interrupts should show gpio-sunxi and ft5x_ts using interrupt #60
Check DMESG for messages concerning ft5x_ts by "sudo dmesg | grep ft5x"
There may be messages showing "irq 60: nobody cared" and "incomplete xfer (0x20)". These can be ignored.
